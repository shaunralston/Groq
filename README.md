# Groq API Speed Test

This Python program allows users to test the response speed of various language models available through the Groq API. Key features include:

1. Interactive model selection from a predefined list of available models.
2. Customizable number of test runs per session.
3. Measures and displays the response time for each run.
4. Calculates and shows the average response time across all runs.
5. Uses a consistent prompt to test different models for comparison.
6. Handles potential errors gracefully, such as invalid model selection or API issues.

The program is designed to help users benchmark the performance of different Groq models, allowing for easy comparison of speed and response quality across various AI language models.
